#Temperature

This is a program I made while learning **C** and **git**. It is not very polished and still under occasional development.

##How to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/LinusLeong/Temperature.git
cd Temperature
mkdir build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
sudo make install
```
